    I would like to give a quick introduction of myself in this webpage. I am a student at Occidental College and I am
    learning Biochemistry. I am Japanese and a quarter Taiwanese. I like to watch Soccer and practice Karate on my free
    time. I have experience teaching karate both to adults and kids so please feel free to ask me if you ever feel like
    learning Karate with me!
